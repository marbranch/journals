# What I Learned Today 

## Thoughts on the Final Project 
- I have enjoyed the collaborative work we have been doing for the final project. I worked on the timeline portion and I feel as though it will be useful tool in the future. 

- Although it was strenuous work trying to find correlating manuscript pages, I found the ending product to be so satisfying. In the future, I would love to play around with HTML so I can make the timeline itself more visually appealing. 


## Other courses 
- I spent most of my day today working on finishing up my other classes. I found that I am horrific at time management and really left so much of my coursework for today. 

- For example, I finished two exams today and still have one more to complete along with learning checks/homework for stats as well as journal files and comments to *Walden*.
