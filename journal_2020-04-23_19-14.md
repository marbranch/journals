## What I Reviewed Today 

- I remembered that the script we made for starting a new journal with the current date and time is in my finder under journal.sh
After writing out yesterday's date, I was ecstatic to rediscover this script.

- Here, I will list out some commands off the top of my head for safe keeping 
    - cd is for moving up one directory 
    - ls lists all files and directories 
    - mkdir creates a new directory 
    - pwd let's you know which folder you're in 
    - echo copies message
