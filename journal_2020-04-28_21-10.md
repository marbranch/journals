## What I Reviewed Today 

- I honestly spent a lot of my day doing statistics for another class and am currently sort of exhausted. I do plan to review the bulk of this course's material tomorrow, but I will jot some notes down right now. 

- **Types of Reading**

    - *Close reading* is a kind of reading that observes patterns in a text (literary elements) in order to interpret the text
    - *Hyperreading* is used to find the most relevant information quickly (ex. skimming)
    - *Machine reading* or *distant reading* relies on a computer to help a reader perform the intended task (ex. how I used Voyant Tools to find word frequency in my last journal)
    - *Metareading* is for when you want to make a claim about a text, you are looking for evidence to prove your argument
        - A *fluid text* is a text "whose meaning canâ€™t be fully understood apart from what we know about their textual history" (Schacht, Canvas).
            - Instead of looking at the text as a fixed, permanent object, think of it as an ongoing project subject to constant changes
            
        
## For next time, 
I will continue the modules and exercises on Canvas, next up TimelineJS!
